    <img src="https://github.com/lullabymia/Final-Project-for-People-s-Daily/blob/master/pictures/one%20belt.png?raw=true" alt="cover photo">
    <p>"One Belt One Road" was most frequently mentioned in 2017, May with more than 2000 times, in the past year ended November, 30. That's because "One Belt One Road" forum was held in Beijing in May, 14 and 15, with presidents or prime ministers from 24 countries participating. </p>
    <img src="https://github.com/lullabymia/Final-Project-for-People-s-Daily/blob/master/pictures/greater%20bay.png?raw=true" alt="cover photo">
    <p>"Greater Bay Area" was firstly mentioned in Feb. 2017 and appeared frequently since the begining of 2018. That is because the relationship between mainland and Hong Kong became more and more intimate. In  2018, July, President Xi witnessed signing of the Framework Agreement for Deepening the Cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao to promote the construction of the Greater Bay. In addition, on 2018, September, 23, mainland-Hong Kong high-speed rail opened. </p>

   <p>"Xi's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" has become a common word in People's Daily in the last twelve months. Its word frequency exceeded 400 and 500 in 2017, October and 2018, March respectively. This is related with two historical decisons. 
        On 2017, October, Xi's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics was added into constitution of Chinese Communist Party during the closing ceremony of 19th CPC National Congress. Following that, the 13th National People’s Congress passed a Constitutional Amendment and decided to write it into People's Republic of China Constitution. After the two events, "Xi's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" has maintained its high frequency in People's Daily. 
    </p>

    <h2> Reform and Opening-up Policy in 2008 and 2018 </h2>

   
    <img src="https://github.com/lullabymia/Final-Project-for-People-s-Daily/blob/master/pictures/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E5%BF%AB%E7%85%A7%202018-12-16%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%883.14.26.png?raw=true" alt="cover photo">
    <p>Words concrening Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-up policy have a sudden increase around December because of 30th and 40th anniversary of that policy. 
        </p>
    <p>An article about Xi’s policy in People’s Daily said “To keep away from subversive mistakes on Reform and Opening-up Policy, we uphold Xi’s socialism with Chinese characteristics with which the party neither treading the old path nor go away on matters of principles.” The fact that the policy has gone through a transformation under Xi’s administration could be in inferred.
   <p>Gao Jingwen, a head of the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Hong Kong Baptist University, believes that under the background of the decline of democracy worldwide, the Communist Party of China has demonstrated its ability to self-adjust and control the situation in a long period of time. Ming Kesheng, associate professor in School of Law Department  at the Fordham university, says that China’s reform and opening-up policy have ended during Xi's administration. 
    </p>

    <p>From People's daily, enormous changes have taken place in China. The overall picture is transforming from every cultural and economic domain where new trend and policy keep refreshing people's perception towards the country. Development and cooperation become the mainstream of China in 2018 but seeking economic development will remain the future endeavours of China.
